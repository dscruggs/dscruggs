### Dan Scruggs 👋

I currently work as a Data Scientist and Consultant developing ML capabilities for mid and large-size businesses.

I use github as mainly a personal knowledge store for reference while working. Here's some of my most commonly used repos:
-  [📚 machinelearningnotes](https://github.com/dscruggs/machinelearningnotes) - A repo for storing some of my learnings in ML. Books, cloud certs, best practices, and some code
-  [🛠️ devopsscaffold](https://github.com/dscruggs/devopsscaffold) - A basic python project set up with CICD using a makefile for an easy command line interface
-  [🏫 schoolwork](https://github.com/dscruggs/omscs) - Projects from my CS Masters at Georgia Tech specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. This repo is private per the Academic Conduct policy of GT, but there were some cool projects in the program. Happy to share if you're curious!

I'm also working on some personal projects in my spare time around MLOps. I should have more to share soon.
