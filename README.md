### Dan Scruggs

I currently work as an AI Engineer devoping predictive and generative solutions for enterprises.

I use github primarily as a personal knowledge store for reference. You can find some of my notes from learnings that I have public in my [devnotes](https://github.com/dscruggs/devnotes) repo.

My current interests outside of direct AI work are:
1. computers at the hardware and low level software layer
2. modern web development (particularly WebGPU and WASM)

Here's some of my projects:
-  [🐦 Lyre Studio](https://github.com/dscruggs/lyre-studio) - An AI-powered voice editor using open source models and spotify's Pedalboard library. Designed to be deployed and run fully locally.
-  [🛠️ devopsscaffold](https://github.com/dscruggs/devopsscaffold) - A basic python project set up with CICD using a makefile for an easy command line interface
-  [🏫 schoolwork](https://github.com/dscruggs/omscs) - Projects from my CS Masters at Georgia Tech specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. This repo is private per the Academic Conduct policy of GT, but I'm happy to share my work if you're curious!
