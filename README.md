### Dan Scruggs

I currently work as an AI Engineer developing predictive and generative solutions for enterprises.

I use GitHub primarily as a personal knowledge store for reference. You can find some of my learning notes that I’ve made public in my [devnotes](https://github.com/dscruggs/devnotes) repo.

My current interests outside of direct AI work are:
1. Computer hardware and low-level software
2. Modern web development (particularly WebGPU and WASM)

Here's some of my projects:
-  [🐦 Lyre Studio](https://github.com/dscruggs/lyre-studio) - An AI-powered voice editor using open source models and spotify's Pedalboard library. Designed to be deployed and run fully locally.
-  [🛠️ devopsscaffold](https://github.com/dscruggs/devopsscaffold) - A basic python project template set up with automated testing and CI.
-  [🏫 schoolwork](https://github.com/dscruggs/omscs) - Projects from my CS Masters at Georgia Tech specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. This repo is private per the Academic Conduct policy of GT, but I'm happy to share my work if you're curious!
